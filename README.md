# [UDACITY] Seattle Airbnb Analysis
The [Settle Airbnb Open Dateset](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle) is chosen for **UDACITY Project - Write a Data Science Blog** Post.


# Installation
Aside from the Anaconda Python package, no further libraries should be required to run the code. Python versions 3.* should run the code without a hitch.

# Project Motivation
Airbnb has been allowing visitors and hosts to expand their travel options and provide a more distinctive, personalised way of experiencing the world since 2008. Airbnb has evolved into a one-of-a-kind service that is used and recognised all over the world. The company's data analysis of millions of listings offered by Airbnb is a critical aspect. These millions of listings generate a lot of data, which can be analysed and used for a variety of purposes, including security, business decisions, understanding customer and provider (host) behaviour and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, and implementing innovative additional services, among others.

The **Seatlle Airbnb Open Dataset** catalogues homestay listings in Seattle, Washington from 01-2016 to 01-2017.


There are 3 subsets in the dataset:
1. The pricing for each listing id for a certain day is described in **calendar.csv**.
1. **listings.csv** contains a detailed description of each listing id, as well as review scores.
1. For each individual listing id, **reviews.csv** gives detailed reviews.

In this project, we are going to use **calendar.csv** and **listings.csv** to answer 3 business questions and follow CRISP_DM steps:
1. Which is the most busiest time in Settle?
2. Where is the most crowdest in Settle?
3. Price Prediction.

6 steps of CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining):
1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Modelling
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment
